      "The Last Romantics",
      "The second novel from the writer behind New York Times best-seller The House Girl is a modern epic. When poet Fiona Skinner is asked about the inspiration behind her most famous work, she begins to trace the arc of her childhood. She recalls her father's unexpected death, her mother's descent into a paralyzing depression, and her siblings' determined survival. Her father's death shaped each of their lives and still haunts Fiona in her work. In the vein of Commonwealth, The Last Romantics is a sweeping look at what binds families together.",

      "Set in the 1930s in Malaysia, The Night Tiger opens when 11-year-old houseboy Ren discovers his master has just died. The master's final wish was for Ren to find the man’s finger—which he’d lost years before in an accident—so it can be buried with him. If the boy fails to find it, his master will be cursed and his soul will forever wander the earth. Across the district, Ji Lin, an apprentice dressmaker and dance hall girl by night, comes across an item that one of her dance partners has left behind, which sends her on her own adventure. Ren’s and Ji Lin’s paths soon crisscross as they embark on their journeys. It’s a book for fans of Isabel Allende and for those who love a murder mystery with a beautiful backdrop.",

Much like these two shows, this book also centers on a young woman posing as an amateur detective to solve a murder. Back in 2009 the novel's protagonist, Lindsay, partied with her friends and the queen bee of their group, Edie. After a long night of binge drinking, Lindsay woke up to find Edie dead of an apparent suicide. Now, a decade later, Lindsay discovers new evidence that could prove that Edie was murdered—and that Lindsay might have been involved. The rest of this haunting debut follows Lindsay as she tries to piece together what really happened on that awful, forgotten night.",

Quick refresher: It was about a college-age girl who sleeps with an older man because she feels like she “owes” it to him, not quite because she wants to. In her debut collection, Roupenian continues to explore the inner workings of sex, trauma, kinks, and manipulation.",

Jess just wants to make a little extra cash when she decides to participate in a study on ethics with the mysterious Dr. Lydia Shields. The premise seems simple: Answer a few questions, then collect. But soon the doctor’s questions turn from simple survey queries to something much more sinister—leaving Jess unsure of whom she can trust. An early contender for thriller of the year.",

Scharer’s plot takes off when Miller travels to Paris where she meets photographer Man Ray, who becomes her collaborator and lover. While most stories about Miller paint her as Ray’s muse, this one portrays her as the independent and daring artist she truly was.",
